# Learn Chinese Game

A simple browser game for kids to learn basic Chinese characters using a board-game style interface. The board loops endlessly like a game of Monopoly.

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.

2. Choose your character token.
3. Click `擲骰子` to roll the dice and watch the token move.
4. When you land on a square, a flashcard appears with a Chinese character and three zhuyin options.
5. Choose the correct zhuyin to earn ⭐ points. The phonetic symbols are shown vertically in standard bopomofo style.
6. Squares you answer correctly are marked with a ✔.
7. The board's first and last cells are shown with 🚩 and 🏁 icons.
8. Completing a lap around the board awards an extra +10 ⭐.
9. A boss waits on the final square. Answer three questions in a row to defeat it! A wrong answer shows a losing icon and moves you back ten spaces.
10. Click the 🎵 icon to hear each reading, or listen automatically when a card opens.
11. On touch devices, swipe across the board to move your character.
